# macOS-InstallRoot
A macOS application that downloads and installs the latest DoD CA Certificates for access to DoD infrastructure.

Pulls the Allcerts.zip from https://militarycac.com then installs them into the keychain database.

This can be applied multiple times without worry to breaking the certifications as it will simply overwrite the old copies.
